    <h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2>
    <p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
    HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification,
    it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts
    and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
    To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
    CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>
    <h2>Inline CSS</h2> 
    <p>An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
    To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style
    attribute can contain any CSS property.</p>
    <h2>Multiple Style Sheets</h2>
    <p>If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different
    style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. </p>
    <h2>The CSS Box Model</h2>
    <p>All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used
    when talking about design and layout.
    The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists
    of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.</p>
    <h2>Font Family</h2>
    <p>The font family of a text is set with the font-family property.
    The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system.
    If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font, and so on.
    Start with the font you want, and end with a generic family, to let the browser pick
    a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.</p>
    <h2>The display Property</h2>
    <p>The display property specifies if/how an element is displayed.
    Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is.
    The default display value for most elements is block or inline.</p>
